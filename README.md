# Matte

Matte is a UI component library on top of MUI and other react libraries.
MATTE stands for MATerial Typography Experience. It's build on top of Material UI and other great React libraries. It is supposed to be as good as Material Design, but not as shiny (hence the matte appearence). Matte is ideal for rapid dashboard prototyping.
